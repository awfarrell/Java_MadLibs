The NYPD held a press conference on Friday to address the issue, following days of criticism for not announcing the incident when it happened three days prior.

"Accidental discharges happen every single year and we average about eight a year and we don't get request [for information] on it," NYPD spokesperson Sergeant Tarik Sheppard said.

"If you do ask about it, we'll talk about it like we're doing right now."

The NYPD said in a statement on Thursday night that an unnamed Emergency Service Unit officer was using a firearm's flashlight attachment to illuminate a barricade inside Hamilton Hall, which protesters occupied after being ordered to disperse.
